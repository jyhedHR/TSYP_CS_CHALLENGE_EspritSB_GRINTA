<p align=""> We evaluated our deepfake detection model's performance by using a rigorous process on both deepfakes and shallowfakes. We employed relevant metrics and diverse datasets to quantify its accuracy and generalizability, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential biases for each type of manipulation. <br> This approach provides a clear understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations, enabling targeted improvements and insights into its performance across a wider spectrum of manipulated media. Based on the findings, we will refine the model, continuously monitor its performance, and explore additional evaluation techniques for further development and effectiveness.

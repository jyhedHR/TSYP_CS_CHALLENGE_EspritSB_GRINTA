This section outlines the crucial data preparation phase, laying the groundwork for successful deepfake detection. We begin by introducing the overall process and its significance.<br> Next, we delve into the meticulous task of downloading and securing the necessary datasets, including DeepFake, CASIAv2, CASIAv1, Columbia, NIST16 and COVERAGE . <br>This ensures comprehensive coverage of diverse deepfake examples and provides a robust basis for model training.<br> We then carefully update the paths and prepare the environment, ensuring smooth operation throughout the experiment. By following these meticulous steps, we establish a strong foundation upon which our deepfake detection model will be built.
